Nougat Tasker Tethering Toggle
====================

Android 7.1 broke Tasker's "WiFi Tether" action (Tethering will be enabled, but no client will be able to connect). 

This plugin provides alternative way to enable working WiFi hotspot on newer Android versions. Depending on your phone and your carrier, it might require ROOT to function.
